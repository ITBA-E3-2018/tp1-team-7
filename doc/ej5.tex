\section{Two BCD addition}
Given two numbers in BCD format, return the two-digits value of the sum of these two numbers.
In order to implement this task, two 4-bit Full Adders were used.
Assuming that inputs are valid, there are just two cases to analyze. 
First of all, if the sum of the two numbers in decimal is less than 9, the sum of them showed in binary code is the actual BCD.
If that is not the case, we have to add 6 to the sum of those two numbers in order to get the BCD.

%\begin{equation}
%    \label{simple_equation}
%    \alpha = \sqrt{ \beta }
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Input}Binary to BCD Conversion A
Two BCD digits must be entered.
