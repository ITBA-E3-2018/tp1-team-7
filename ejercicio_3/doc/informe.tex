The binary decoder is a combinational logic device with n input lines and 2^{n} output lines, one particular combination of inputs activates one output while the remaining ones are disabled. The decoder only works when the enable input is on. Below you can find the truth table and the logic implementation of a 2 input decoder:

A multiplexer, also known as 'mux', is another combinational circuit that has 2^{M} inputs, M select lines and one single output. The select input lines control which data input is connected to the output. The function of a 2 input Mux is described by the truth table shown below, as well as its logic implementation:

\subsection*{About the code}

In one hand, both mux.v and decoder.v modules, use conditional statements to describe their behaviour. This way is easier for the user to understand how the devices work.
Each module has its own test bench which considers all possible inputs.

On the other hand, newmux.v and newdecoder.v, have a variable parameter which changes the number of inputs the devices could have. The way that they are implemented is more difficult to understand than the first one, but it is shorter. Another difference is that in this case the input is not just one bit, is an array of all the input's bits together.
