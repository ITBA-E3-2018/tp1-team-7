# Electronics III - TP1

- Latex compilation is global, and it is made by running the command 'make' inside the root directory Doc folder is for latex source files, and data folder is for docs images


- There are some doc files inside taks folders but they should have been erased, that is in our TODO list, the real files a re in doc and data folders


- Verilog compilation is task by task, and it is made by running 'make' (or make target for excersises with more than one target) inside task directory.  When you run binaries inside bin folder tests cases inputs and results are shown.

- There is only one exception. The task 1 is done in python, so we didn't made a makefile. Tests cases are shown by running 'test.sh'. The python file is called 'run.py', and it has three parameters, a,b,c that are described in doc files.
