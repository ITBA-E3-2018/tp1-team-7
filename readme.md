# Electronics III - First assigment

- Latex compilation is global, and it is made by running the command 'make' inside the root directory. Doc folder is for latex source files, and data folder is for docs images. Setup has some important tex files. Pdf file is generated in root directory.


- There are some doc files inside tasks folders but they should have been erased, We are sorry cause we ran out of time to do it. The real doc files are in doc, data and setup folders


- Verilog compilation is done task by task, and it is made by running 'make' (to make all targets) or 'make "target"'. It should be done inside corresponding task directory.  When you run binaries inside bin folder tests cases inputs and results are shown.

- There is only one exception. The task 1 is done in python, so we didn't made a makefile (Maybe in the future). Tests cases are shown by running 'test.sh'. The python file is called 'run.py', and it has three parameters, a,b,c that are described in doc files.

- We're sorry we did't translate 'ejercicio' to 'task' in folders. We ran out of time.
